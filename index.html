            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am 26 years old and currently studying Computer Science in Denmark.
                I have a strong interest in programming, including backend development, frontend development, databases, and iOS development.
                In my free time, I enjoy cycling and playing football.

                        Heatwave is a project I created as part of my studies as an AP Computer Science student in my third semester.
                        The project involved using a Raspberry Pi to collect data, which was then displayed on a user-friendly interface. 
                        Together with five fellow students, we were tasked with developing a temperature system. We used an API to retrieve the outdoor temperature and a Raspberry Pi to measure the indoor temperature. 
                        Based on these two data points, the program was designed to determine the optimal room temperature for the given environment.

                    </h3>
                    <p>BeerCellar is a project I developed as part of my elective course in Mobile Development during the fourth semester of my Computer Science AP studies. 
                        The project involved creating an Android app using Kotlin, where we were provided with a pre-defined API to work with. The app allowed users to create, update, and delete beers. 
                        Additionally, I implemented Firebase for user authentication, ensuring that each user has their own personalized list of beers and cannot view the beers added by others in the API.

                    <h3>CoreMLTextModel</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project was part of my fourth-semester exam. I chose to write about how AI/ML models can be utilized in mobile development.
                        The project was developed using SwiftUI, and I implemented Apple's own ML model, BERT-Squad.
                        This model enables the app to answer questions based on a given piece of context.
